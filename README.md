# Plants vs Zombies 

## Introduction.
This is the implementation of the popular game Plants vs Zombies. Plants vs Zombies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies) is a tower-defense and strategy game which involves an army of zombies trying to enter the house(lawn) and eat your brains. The only way you can stop them is by using your arsenal of plants that will zap the zombies at your command. The plants - Pea-shooters, Beetroots, Walnuts, and Sunflowers - are all set to destroy the zombies who dare to enter your backyard.

## Description
A game similar to Plants vs. Zombie, . The player can place different plants, each with their own unique offensive/defensive capabilities, around a house, in order to stop a horde of zombies from reaching the house of the residents. A zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane. Planting costs "sun", which can be gathered by planting sunflowers. The plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in. 

In our implementation we have provided the users with 3 plants:

- PeaShooter - Peashooter is the first and the primary attacking plant the game. It is a peashooting plant that shoots peas on seeing a zombie. It costs 100 suns.
- SunFlower - Sunflower is an essential sun-producing plant which is necessary for producing suns - the currency of the game. It costs 50 suns. Each sun produced from sunflower adds 25 units to your sun counter.
- Walnut - Walnut is the defensive plant that acts as a shield for the player's plants. It takes a long time for zombies to eat it, providing an effective cover for the plants located behind it. It is mainly used to stall zombies to waste their time, letting other plants attack them.

In this mini-version we implemented only 2 zombies:

- Regular Zombie - Normal zombies and their time-themed variants in Plants vs. Zombies 2 are the most basic "zombie" units. In fact, it takes four shots for a pea plant to kill them. Having no special defensive equipment or travel abilities, these zombies are susceptible to any type of attack.
- Bucket Zombie - It's a tough zombie and it takes the PeaShooter more shots than regular zombie to kill it.
